# Project Charter: Congo Basin Community Monitoring Initiative

## Mission
Empower local communities in the Congo Basin to monitor forest health and wildlife through systematic data collection, fostering sustainable conservation and adaptive management.

## Objectives
1. Train 50 community members in forest monitoring techniques within the first year.
2. Collect at least 1,000 data points on wildlife sightings and forest health indicators annually.
3. Establish a community-led patrol network covering 200 km² of protected area.
4. Improve anti-poaching response time by 30% through real-time data reporting.
5. Enhance local capacity for conservation decision-making through participatory workshops.

## Stakeholders
- Local Indigenous Communities
- Regional Conservation NGOs (e.g., Wildlife Conservation Society)
- National Government Agencies (Ministry of Environment)
- Research Institutions (Universities)
- International Donors
- Private Sector Partners (Eco-tourism)

## Methodology
- Use standardized field data sheets (both paper and digital) for consistent data collection.
- Implement mobile data collection apps (ODK/Kobo Toolbox) for real-time upload.
- Conduct monthly community patrols along designated transects.
- Hold quarterly review meetings to discuss findings and adapt strategies.
- Establish a central database for data storage and analysis.

## Timeline
- Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Stakeholder engagement and training curriculum development.
- Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Pilot data collection and tool refinement.
- Phase 3 (Months 7-12): Full-scale monitoring, data analysis, and first annual report.
- Phase 4 (Months 13-24): Scaling to adjacent communities and integration with national monitoring systems.

## Budget
- Equipment (GPS units, cameras, tablets): $15,000
- Training materials and workshops: $10,000
- Community incentives and stipends: $20,000
- Data management and analysis: $5,000
- Contingency (10%): $5,000
- **Total Estimated Budget**: $55,000

## Monitoring & Evaluation
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): number of trained monitors, data points collected, patrol coverage, incidents reported.
- Quarterly progress reviews with stakeholders.
- Annual external evaluation by independent conservation experts.
- Community feedback surveys to assess satisfaction and impact.

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Security risks**: Patrols in remote areas. Mitigation: Safety training, satellite communication, coordination with authorities.
- **Data quality issues**: Inconsistent reporting. Mitigation: Regular calibration sessions, data validation protocols.
- **Community engagement barriers**: Lack of trust or incentives. Mitigation: Transparent communication, fair compensation, co‑design of protocols.
- **Funding uncertainty**: Dependence on grants. Mitigation: Diversify funding sources, develop sustainable income streams (e.g., eco‑tourism).

## Governance
- Steering Committee comprising community representatives, NGO partners, and government officials.
- Monthly coordination meetings.
- Clear reporting lines and decision‑making authority delegated to local coordinators.
